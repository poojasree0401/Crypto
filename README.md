This Python code creates a user-friendly GUI application using tkinter for encoding and decoding messages with a Caesar cipher. The interface features input fields for the message and key, buttons for encryption and decryption, and a display for the result. The decode_message function decodes the input message using the provided key, handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and displays the result. It also tracks incorrect attempts, showing a warning after three failed tries and closing the application. The GUI includes a custom title bar and styled widgets for a polished look. Additional buttons for resetting inputs and exiting the application are also provided. The encoding function is a placeholder, ready for implementation. This setup serves as a foundation for learning about cryptography and GUI development in Python.
